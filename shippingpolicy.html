            <h2>Shipping Fees</h2>

            <h2>Shipping Restrictions</h2>
            <p>Certain gaming products may have restrictions on where they can be shipped due to legal regulations. It's essential to ensure that the items you order comply with your local laws and regulations. We wouldn't want any quests to be interrupted by unexpected legal hurdles.</p>
